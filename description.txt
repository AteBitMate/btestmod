Hey! Thanks for taking a look at this. This is a mod designed to bring classes from other mods, namely Thorium and Redemption, up to the level of endgame Calamity in order to extend their effective playable lifespans. Currently this includes Bard from Thorium on this mod and Druid on Bill's Cross-mod Content 2. This mod is not officially endorsed or supported by the Thorium, Calamity, or Redemption developers, and some parts of it may be unstable or not work properly. This is really just because I wanted to play Bard at the end of Calamity.
